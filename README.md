A simple university simulator consisting of two packages. 
The first package, 'base,' includes a class called Person. 
The second package, 'uni,' contains six classes: Student, Course, Major, Professor, PresentedCourse, and Transcript. 
In the Main class, five objects of the Person class were created; 
three of them were assigned to students, while the remaining two were designated as professors. 
Two majors, Art and Computer Science, were established. The courses 'Basic Programming' and 'Advanced Programming' are offered under the Computer Science major, 
while the course 'Art' is offered under the Art major. 
Finally, the students' transcripts were printed, and their GPAs were calculated.
